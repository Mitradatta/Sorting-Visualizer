# Sorting Visualizer



## Introduction

Sorting Visualizer is a web based interactive tool to visualize the classic **Sorting Algorithms** such as **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, **Merge Sort**, and **Quick Sort** inorder to get a better understanding of what happens under the hood when code is executed.


## Importance
  
In the context of Data structures and Algorithms, sorting alorithms are the building concepts a computer science student must understand whcih later helps them in understanding more complex concepts such as traverversing **"Trie"** data structure(**Inorder-traversal, Preorder-traversal, Postorder-traversal**).



## Technologies Used
- **HTML** 
- **CSS** 
- **Javascript** 
- **Bootstrap** 


## How to Use

- You can select the sorting algorithm which you want to visualize from the navigation bar.
- And press **"Start Simulation"** button.
- You can also see the **pseudo code** for each of the algorithm on the right side of the page along with time complexity.
